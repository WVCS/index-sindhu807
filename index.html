    <h1> The Cold War </h1>
    <h2> What is the cold war? </h2> 
    <p> The cold war was a war fought between the Soviet Union and  the United States with their respective allies.  It was a war based on propaganda, economic, and political  fronts as it was rarely fought in person but rather through threats, spying, and manipulation. Each country possessed many weapons, some which could wipe out millions of people.  It was a time of fear and anticipation. </p>

     <td> The Berlin Airlift: 
The Soviets did not want Germany unified, they wanted it to be broken. The United States and its allies wanted Germany to be unified. Therefore France, Britain, and the United States withdrew their forces from Germany in order for it to unify. However the Soviets held West Berlin hostage and tried to starve the country so that the Allies would surrender West Berlin or give up their idea of unifying Germany. However, American and British officials flew food and resources into West Berlin for 11 months until May 1949 when the Soviets admitted defeat.

The United States had atomic bombs and the Soviet Union exploded their own in 1949.
